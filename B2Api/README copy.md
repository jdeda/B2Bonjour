This package provides an implememtation to the B2 Api using the @Dependency
architecture from PointFree.co
This opens the door for modernizing iOS and macOS software that needs to interact with 
B2 servers in a tremendeous way.
SPMs for one are supported in Linux and Windows.

This package will also depend on some basic fundamental bits.
The versions are pinned.
